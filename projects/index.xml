      <description>Blurter is a tool for the construction of branching dialog trees and other interactive narratives. Implemented in React, its design is heavily by my background working as a game writer/designer.

      <description>Slumber is an Incrementer (&amp;ldquo;clicker&amp;rdquo;) game with strong narrative elements I&amp;rsquo;m implementing in React-Redux. It&amp;rsquo;s still very much a work in progress, but the first third of the game is fairly playable.
On a side-note, Redux is absolutely not the right solution for state management for something with a traditional game loop, but it&amp;rsquo;s been very interesting exploring its limits in this application.

      <title>URL Lengthener</title>
      <link>https://chrisbucholz.github.io/projects/urlshortener/</link>

      <guid>https://chrisbucholz.github.io/projects/urlshortener/</guid>
      <description>A full stack applet intended for shortening URLs. Front end is React. Back end is in Node.js/Express and MongoDB, hosted on glitch.com.
Due to the length of Glitch&amp;rsquo;s default project urls, this code is more commonly a URL lengthener in its current state, hence the name. If for some reason you wanted to invest in this technology, we may first need to set some money aside for a shorter domain.</description>
